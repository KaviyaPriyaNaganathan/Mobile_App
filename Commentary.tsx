        <Text strong>12:23 am</Text> - Chennai and Shivam Dube finish off the run chase and have won the first game of the season. Alzarri Joseph pitches the ball up with pace on the pads of Shivam Dube who looks to flick the ball but gets a hit on the pads and the ball rolls away to the fine leg fence for a boundary. Bengaluru take the review but the Ball Tracking shows that the ball has pitched outside the leg stump.
